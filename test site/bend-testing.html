                    Bend tests deform the test material at the midpoint 
                    causing a concave surface or a bend to form without the<br>
                    occurrence of fracture and are typically performed to 
                    determine the ductility or resistance to fracture of <br>
                    that material. Unlike in a flexure test the goal is not to 
                    load the material until failure but rather to deform the sample <br>
                    into a specific shape. The test sample is loaded in a way that 
                    creates a concave surface at the midpoint with a specified <br>
                    radius of curvature according to the standard in relation 
                    to which the test is performed. Bending tests are as popular <br>
                    as tensile test, compression test, and fatigue tests.

                <h2 style="padding-left: 2%;">Common Bend Tests</h2>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">
                    There are four common types of bend tests. In a guided bend test,
                    the sample is placed horizontally across two supports and then <br>
                    a force applied to the top of the midpoint deforming the sample into
                    a “U” shape. In a semi-guided bend test, the specimen’s midpoint is <br>
                    bent to a specific angle or inside radius. In a free bend test,
                    the ends of the sample are pushed together, but no force is applied <br>
                    to the bend itself. Finally, a common fracture toughness test (ASTM E399)
                    consists of a sample with a precracked starter crack on the bottom<br>
                    side of the midpoint which is loaded into a 3-point bend fixture so that
                    the midpoint force is applied on the opposite face from the fracture.
